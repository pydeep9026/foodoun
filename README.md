<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT --> 
## About The Project

this website basically has been built to compare prices between three delivery platforms so that users can get a cheaper price on food items but the twist is since these platforms do not provide api for this type of thing ,everything you see here is just a show and will only work only when actual api is available from all these platform until then you will only see the api that i have built myself wiht fake prices and images and ratings and reviews !!!!! enjoy
